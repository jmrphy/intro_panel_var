## What is VAR?

> - "Vector autoregression" refers to an "*n*-equation, *n*-variable linear model in which each variable is in turn explained by its own lagged values, plus current and past values of the remaining n - 1 variables." (Stock and Watson 2001)

> - Standard tool of econometrics since the 1980s (Sims 1980).
    - Somewhat controversial because it's rather atheoretical
    
> - At a minimum, VAR is a powerful tool for revealing the "stylized facts" of covariation in time series data
